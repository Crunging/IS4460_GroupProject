IS4460 Group Project
By: Logan Preston, Arjun Pillai, Peter Callahan, Marielis Alvarez

The objective of our building management system is to successfully grant
and withhold access to every building for the three main groups of University
patrons; students, faculty & staff and lastly university guests. The University of
Utah campus has over 12 million gross square feet, 100 buildings and almost
50,000 daily campus visitors. Limiting users' access to different buildings as well
as different sectors in buildings takes great coordination and effort to ensure all
parties remain safe and happy. Our project aims at creating a web application
that can serve the University as the main hub for creating, updating and deleting
users and building permission records.
